In the following .ino file was used to decode the IR hexadecimal value coming from the IR control from the AC.

It was used:

* Arduino board
* Hx1838 sensor (In order to decode the hex value which will be typed in the ESP32 code)

 STEPS:
	Connect the signal pin to D2 from the Arduino board and load the IR_Receiver_Decoder file.

	Open the serial monitor and set it up with 115200 baud rate.

 *	"Ready to receive IR signals of protocols: NEC, Panasonic/Kaseikyo, Denon/Sharp, Sony, RC5, RC6, LG, JVC, Samsung, Whynter, Lego Power Functions, Bosewave , MagiQuest, Universal Distance, Hash at pin 2" <--Message printed in the serial monitor

	Push the button which will be decoded in order to perform an action (In this case for the Air Conditioner).

 *	"Protocol=LG Address=0x88 Command=0x90 Raw-Data=0x8800909 28 bits MSB first"	<--Message printed in the serial monitor afer pushing a button

	Save the hex value that appears like in this example: "Raw-Data=0x8800909 "

	The hex value for that ON button was: 8800909
